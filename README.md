# TODO

- need an edit/add new bookmark page that triggers on a URL (just the URL when not alread exists, otherwise prefilled with all existing data and I can save)
- attempt to build bookmarklet around edit page by window.open the edit page with the current page's URL as a parameter
- import command line mode: takes a path to a bookmarks.html and imports all those entries into a user's bookmarks, adding to all existing ones (need to detect duplicates and ignore?)
- delete bookmark
- edit bookmark (inline editing form?) (low prio, but since I need a separate create bookmark page for the bookmarklet/extension this may also be the way (see for example when adding a bookmark that is already added, it becomes an edit))
